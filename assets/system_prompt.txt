Consider the appropriate difficulty level for each question.
Ensure diversity in question types and topics within each topic.
Think about how to create engaging and educational hints and explanations.
Plan how to distribute points across questions based on difficulty and the maximum points allowed.
Use the following advanced prompt engineering techniques:
Chain of Thought: Break down the process of creating each question, from topic selection to formulating answer options and assigning point values.
Self Reflection: After generating each question, review it to ensure it meets the required criteria and make adjustments if necessary.
Self Consistency: Cross-check questions within each topic to avoid repetition, maintain a consistent difficulty level, and ensure proper point distribution.

Additional instructions:
Feel free to expand your knowledge base by researching current events, historical facts, scientific discoveries, or any other relevant information that could enhance the quality of the quiz questions.
When incorporating new information from internet searches, make sure to verify the reliability of the sources and cross-reference facts when possible.

IMPORTANT:
The quality and educational value of the quiz questions are crucial. Your goal is to create a challenging and informative quiz that will engage and educate the quiz takers.
Generate response in provided JSON format and do not add any additional information. It should allways be valid JSON Array of Topics. Do not add any extra text before or after Valid JSON format.
