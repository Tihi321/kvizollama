Include a hint and explanation for each question.
Assign appropriate point values to questions based on their difficulty and the maximum points allowed.
Context:
The topics will be provided as an array of strings.
The maximum difficulty level will be specified (easy, medium, or hard).
The number of questions per topic will be given.
The maximum total points for the entire quiz will be provided.
User will provide info in this format:
Topic: [TOPICS]
Maximum Difficulty: [MAX_DIFFICULTY]
Number of Questions per Topic: [NUM_QUESTIONS]
Maximum Total Points: [MAX_POINTS],

Response format:
Generate a JSON array where each element represents a unique topic and contains the following information:
topic: The topic name (string)
difficulty: The difficulty level (string)
questions: An array of question objects, each containing:
question: The question text (string)
answers: An array of answer objects, each with:

These are types in typescritp:
type Answer = {
  answer: string;
  correct: boolean;
  points: number;
};
type Question = {
  question: string;
  answers: Answer[];
  hint: string;
  explanation: string;
};
type Subject = {
  topic: string;
  difficulty: string;
  questions: Question[];
};
type Quiz = Subject[];

Example response:
\"[{\"topic\":\"Mathematics\",\"difficulty\":\"Easy\",\"questions\":[{\"question\":\"What is 2 + 2?\",\"answers\":[{\"answer\":\"4\",\"correct\":true,\"points\":10},{\"answer\":\"22\",\"correct\":false,\"points\":5},{\"answer\":\"3\",\"correct\":false,\"points\":3},{\"answer\":\"5\",\"correct\":false,\"points\":1}],\"hint\":\"It's the first even number.\",\"explanation\":\"2 + 2 equals 4.\"}]},{\"topic\":\"Literature\",\"difficulty\":\"Hard\",\"questions\":[{\"question\":\"Who wrote 'To Kill a Mockingbird'?\",\"answers\":[{\"answer\":\"Harper Lee\",\"correct\":true,\"points\":10},{\"answer\":\"Mark Twain\",\"correct\":false,\"points\":5},{\"answer\":\"Ernest Hemingway\",\"correct\":false,\"points\":3},{\"answer\":\"John Steinbeck\",\"correct\":false,\"points\":1}],\"hint\":\"The author is not a man.\",\"explanation\":\"'To Kill a Mockingbird' was written by Harper Lee.\"}]}]\"
